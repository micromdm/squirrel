* Added /version URL route (#2).
    
    /version returns a JSON object with detailed information of the build environment, 
    including current commit and go version used to build the app. The binary must be built
    with the release script in order for the correct values to be set.
    
* Added /healthz URL route (#2).

    /healthz returns either a 200 OK status or a 500 error depending on the status of the app. 
    Currently, a 500 error is returned only if the repo path is not valid.

* Fixed panic when 0 arguments were passed (#06e92dd).
